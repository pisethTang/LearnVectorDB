Boundary layer control, achieved using suction or blowing methods, can significantly reduce drag on an aircraft's wing surface. By removing the slow-moving air in the boundary layer through suction, the flow remains attached to the wing for longer, delaying separation and reducing form drag. This technique is particularly effective at high angles of attack, where flow separation would otherwise lead to a dramatic increase in drag and loss of lift. The boundary layer is the thin region of airflow closest to the surface of a body moving through a fluid. Within this layer, the velocity of the fluid transitions from zero at the surface (due to the no-slip condition) to the full freestream velocity further away. The nature of the boundary layer — whether laminar or turbulent — has a profound effect on the aerodynamic drag experienced by the aircraft. A laminar boundary layer is smooth and ordered, with fluid flowing in parallel layers. It produces less skin friction drag compared to a turbulent boundary layer. However, laminar flow is inherently unstable and tends to transition to turbulent flow as it moves along a surface, especially when encountering surface roughness or adverse pressure gradients. A turbulent boundary layer, while producing more skin friction drag, has greater momentum and is more resistant to flow separation. This makes aircraft designed for high maneuverability, such as fighter jets, often accept turbulent boundary layers in exchange for better resistance to stall at high angles of attack. Supercritical airfoils are designed to delay the onset of wave drag caused by shock waves at transonic speeds. By flattening the upper surface and increasing camber near the trailing edge, these airfoils keep the airflow over the wing below the local speed of sound for a greater portion of the flight envelope. This allows airliners to fly closer to Mach 1 without encountering the significant drag rise associated with transonic flight. Winglets, the upturned tips found on modern commercial aircraft, reduce induced drag by decreasing the strength of wingtip vortices. These vortices form because high-pressure air beneath the wing flows around the wingtip to the lower pressure region above the wing, creating a rotating mass of air that trails behind the aircraft. Winglets effectively increase the aspect ratio of the wing without a large increase in wingspan, improving fuel efficiency by several percent. The lift-to-drag ratio is one of the most important metrics in aerodynamics, measuring the aerodynamic efficiency of an aircraft. Gliders can achieve lift-to-drag ratios exceeding 50:1, meaning they travel 50 meters forward for every meter of altitude lost. Commercial airliners typically achieve ratios of around 17:1 to 20:1 during cruise, while high-performance fighter aircraft may be optimized for maneuverability at the cost of a lower lift-to-drag ratio. Active flow control technologies are an area of ongoing research. These include plasma actuators that energize the boundary layer using ionized air, synthetic jets that create oscillating flows without requiring any net mass flow, and adaptive wing surfaces that change shape in response to flight conditions. These technologies aim to provide real-time drag reduction and lift enhancement across a wide range of flight conditions. The Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in a fluid, is a key parameter in determining the characteristics of the boundary layer. Low Reynolds number flows, such as those experienced by small drones and insects, are dominated by viscous effects and require different aerodynamic design strategies compared to the high Reynolds number flows typical of large commercial aircraft.
